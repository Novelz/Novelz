<p align="center">I am a freelance web developer. After 3 years as a full stack dev I joined the dark and hidden side of backend development.<br/>
They didn't have cookies but neither pixels.<br/><br/>
In the last couple of years I've had the chance to work on different solutions and platforms, from the classic Wordpress/Woocommerce installation to fully customized CMS, from creating API platforms to integration with management software and the definition of different database schemas.</p>
